# LifeRPG Mobile App/Game

## Description:
Life RPG is a small passion project in which I want to combine fun elements of RP Games with real life working on well-being, good habits and mental health.

## Proof of concept:
- Your in-game avatar stats will improve with you real life tasks: drinking more water, taking breaks, walks.
- You will recive predefined avatar class based on statistics you mainly work in real life: 
  - You read a lot of books? Your INT will be boosted and you may become a Wizard!
- In order to progress in-game and defeat dungeons and bosses you will need stronger stats and skills
